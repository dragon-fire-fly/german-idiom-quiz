# Overview of project
<!-- Am-i-responsive mock up -->

The German Idiom Quiz is an interactive quiz testing the user's knowledge of commonly used German phrases (or 'idioms').
The target audience for this quiz are language learners who speak English and are learning German.
The quiz asks the user to select the correct answer out of four possible options for the translation of a given German idiom.

The user has the option to see a literal English translation (which often does not provide many hints as to the meaning!) and to review the questions at the end of the quiz, providing an educational element to the quiz.

# Features
## Existing Features



<!-- stlye features -->




<!-- JS features -->

- question list with large bank of questions
- randomisation function which shuffles the question bank and selects 12 questions. This allows replayability of the quiz and ensures the same question is not asked more than once in the same play.
- question number and progress bar displayed so user knows how many questions will be asked and which question they are currently answering
- The user is able to view the literal translation of the German phrase in English, if they wish. This allows the user to set their own difficulty level for a given question.
- Under each question are 4 possible answers for the user to choose between. They can simply click the answer to select it. If tthe correct answer is selected, the answer button turns green. If the incorrect answer is selected, the chosen answer button turns red (and the button for the correct answer turns green).
- The score is updated by adding 1 for each correctly answered question, to a maximum of 12.
- At the end of the quiz, the user has the option to see a table of all questions asked in the quiz, their literal translations and their correct answers.

A number of reference sources and tutorials were utilised for this project. The main quiz structure, progress bar and score tracking were based on the YouTube tutorial by [Brian Design](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f4fB9Xg2JEY) with reference to this [Web Dev Simplified](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=riDzcEQbX6k) quiz tutorial.

This [Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/2450954/how-to-randomize-shuffle-a-javascript-array) was helpful for learning how to shuffle a list of objects using JavaScript.

This YouTube video by [Dylan Israel](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ri5Nqe_IK50) helped to implement a table whose values are updated using JavaScript.

Some of the German Idioms used in the quiz were found in these [FluentU](https://www.fluentu.com/blog/german/common-german-idioms/) and [Chatterbug](https://blog.chatterbug.com/en/10-german-idioms-to-sound-more-german/) blog posts.
